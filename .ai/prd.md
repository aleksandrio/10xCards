# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - 10xCards
## 1. Product Overview
10xCards is a web application designed for learners that simplifies and accelerates the process of creating study materials. Its core feature is the ability to automatically generate flashcard sets from any user-provided text. This eliminates the most time-consuming step in study preparation, allowing users to move from notes to active learning much faster. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include a user account system, the ability to create and manage flashcard collections (called Decks), and a simple, clean interface for studying. The application will be fully responsive for both desktop and mobile use.

## 2. User Problem
Students and learners often spend a significant amount of time manually creating flashcards from their notes, textbooks, or articles. This process is tedious, repetitive, and delays the start of the actual learning process. There is a need for a tool that can automate the creation of study materials, making preparation more efficient and allowing users to focus their energy on learning and revision.

## 6. Success Metrics
### 6.1. Primary Success Metric: AI Quality and User Acceptance Rate
- This measures how valuable and relevant the AI-generated flashcards are to the user. A high acceptance rate indicates the AI is effectively solving the core user problem.
- How to Measure: Calculated for each generation event as:
    $$(Initial Cards Generated - Cards Deleted by User) / Initial Cards Generated$$

### 6.2. Engagement Metric: User Activity
- This measures how actively users are engaging with the core learning functionality of the application.
- How to Measure: Number of study sessions initiated per active user per week.
